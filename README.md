- **Healthcare professionals** 
- **General public**
- **Emergency response teams**

Users can practice essential defibrillation skills through authentic hospital scenarios in a safe, controlled environment available 24/7.

### Version 2 (In Development) - Professional Training Suite
The upcoming version will feature:
- **Real-time connectivity** with physical training mannequins
- **Advanced vital signs monitoring**
- **Targeted training** for hospital staff to enhance emergency response efficiency

## ✨ Key Features

### 🔄 Multiple Operating Modes
- **AED Mode (DAE)** - Automated External Defibrillator with voice guidance
- **Manual Mode** - Professional manual defibrillation
- **Monitor Mode** - ECG rhythm monitoring and analysis
- **Stimulator Mode** - Cardiac pacing 

### 📊 Realistic Medical Scenarios
- **Ventricular Fibrillation** - Emergency defibrillation with manual defibrillator
- **AED Training** - Automated external defibrillator operation
- **Cardiac Pacing** - Emergency pacing for heart blocks
- **Cardioversion** - Synchronized cardioversion for arrhythmias

### 🫀 Authentic ECG Rhythms
